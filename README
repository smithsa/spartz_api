RUNNING THE SERVER

Can run it through the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate
    python server.py

Or run it by installing requirements listed in requirements.txt
    easiest way is to use pip by running in terminal "pip install -r requirements.txt"



GENERAL NOTES
I chose to use python and flask because flask-Restful provided a light weight solution.
It's a json api since json is simple and easy to use compared to xml.
In addition, I am utilizing an ORM, SQLAlchemy because it provided for faster development.
